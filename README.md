**DESCRIPTION**:

IN THIS TASK I HAVE PERFORMED AN AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP PROGRAM BY USING VISUAL STUDIO CODE WHICH CAN USED IN REAL FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE WHERE
This basic chatbot code, while simple, can be used in several introductory and educational scenarios, as well as for very limited, specific applications:

1. Educational Purposes:

Introduction to NLP:
It's an excellent starting point for teaching the fundamentals of natural language processing, including tokenization, pattern matching, and basic chatbot design.
It allows students to understand how regular expressions can be used to process and interpret text.
Programming Fundamentals:
It provides practical examples of using dictionaries, functions, loops, and conditional statements in Python.
Students can modify and expand the code to experiment with different programming concepts.
Basic Chatbot Development:
It demonstrates the basic structure of a chatbot, including input processing, response generation, and conversation flow.
2. Simple Interactive Applications:

Basic Question Answering:
You can expand the patterns and responses dictionaries to create a simple question-answering system for a very limited set of topics.
Simple Greeting and Farewell Bot:
It can be used as a simple bot to greet users and provide farewell messages.
Interactive Demonstrations:
This code can be used to demonstrate how simple programs can interact with users.
3. Prototyping and Experimentation:

Rapid Prototyping:
It can be used to quickly prototype basic chatbot ideas and test different interaction patterns.
Experimenting with Regular Expressions:
It provides a platform for experimenting with different regular expression patterns and observing their effects on chatbot behavior.
4. Limited Embedded Applications:

Very Simple Information Displays:
In very limited embedded systems, where resources are constrained, this type of bot could provide very basic information.
Limitations:

It's important to note that this code is very basic and has significant limitations:
It relies on simple pattern matching and cannot handle complex or nuanced language.
It lacks contextual understanding and cannot maintain a coherent conversation.
It's limited to the predefined patterns and responses.


The tools used in this Python chatbot code are:

Python Programming Language: This is the core language used to write the script.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
Specifically, the punkt tokenizer for breaking text into sentences and words.
WordNet, a lexical database for English.
Regular Expressions (re module): Used for pattern matching to identify user intents.
Standard Python Libraries:
random: For selecting random responses.
input(): For getting user input from the console.
print(): For displaying output to the console.
